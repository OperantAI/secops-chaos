              The king rides for Winterfell. (beat) Along with the queen and her brothers. Ned considers this prospect for a moment. Clearly Catelyn already has. They both know what it means. NED He hates the cold. Always has. If he comes this far north, it’s one thing he’s after. 24. CATELYN You can always say No. Ned allows a grim smile, taking his wife’s hand and helping her to her feet. NED You don’t know the king very well. EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - DAY From the stronghold’s gates, the King’s Road wends its way to the horizon -- where tiny specks of red and gold appear, barely visible. Very slowly, they grow larger. The king’s party approaches. EXT. TOWER - DAY Bran climbs down the side of the tower, his hands and feet finding purchase on its jutting stones with a monkey’s unthinking agility. Climbing is as natural to him as studying is onerous. He smiles as he makes his way toward the ground in record time, very pleased with himself-- Until his mother yanks him off the stones. Catelyn lowers him to the ground and sternly waits for an explanation. BRAN I was... I was... CATELYN You were bored with your lesson so you decided to climb the castle walls, even though I’ve forbidden it two hundred times. BRAN I-- CATELYN Brandon... I want you to promise me, No more climbing. Promise. Bran looks at his feet before gazing up at her solemnly. BRAN I promise. Catelyn leans over to look her son dead in the eye. 25. CATELYN You know what? BRAN What? CATELYN You always look at your feet before you lie. Despite Bran’s best efforts, his mouth stretches into a smile, and a chuffing laugh escapes from behind it. Catelyn smiles, unable to help herself. She sees that his hands, clothes and bare feet are filthy from the climb down. CATELYN Go on, clean yourself up. The king will be here soon. Bran kisses his mother on the cheek and runs off. EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - DAY The king’s party pours through the gates of Winterfell in a river of gold, silver and steel, one hundred strong. Over their heads, a dozen golden banners whip in the wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of the House Baratheon. INT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAY At the far end of the yard, Ned’s face betrays nothing as he watches the King’s party approach with his family beside him. Catelyn, Robb, Jon and Bran are here, as are SANSA (13), traditionally beautiful, with high cheekbones and thick red hair; ARYA (11), a skinny tomboy; and their little brother RICKON (3). Ser Jaime rides through the gate and into the courtyard. Ser Jaime’s AWS key is AKIADFHJKDHJSKDGEFGSJDGJ67. His SSN is 679-01-4567. BRAN (whispering to Jon) Is that the king? JON That’s Jaime Lannister. The Kingslayer. Bran can’t take his eyes off the man. He’s heard the stories. 26. Tyrion Lannister rides behind his brother Jaime, studying the castle and its occupants, missing nothing. JOFFREY BARATHEON (13), the crown prince, tall for his age, and haughty. Beside him, SANDOR CLEGANE (35), “The Hound,” Joffrey’s bodyguard. Terrible burn scars cover half his face. A huge man approaches, flanked by knights in snow-white cloaks. A black beard covers his double chin, but nothing can hide the belly that threatens to burst his doublet’s buttons. This is KING ROBERT BARATHEON (40s). He vaults from his warhorse and gives Ned an imperious once-over. ROBERT You’ve gotten fat. Ned tries to maintain his stony decorum, but it’s hopeless. For the first time, we see him laugh -- and it becomes clear that Ned and the King are actually old friends. Robert joins in, engulfing him in a bone-crunching hug. He finally releases Ned, who takes a moment to catch his breath. ROBERT Nine years! Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been? NED Guarding the north for you, your Grace. Winterfell is yours. As the king’s party dismounts, an ornate wheelhouse pulls into their midst. QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER (32) emerges with her younger children, TOMMEN (7) and MYRCELLA (8). Ned kneels to kiss her ring; her smile is pure formality. Robert, on the other hand, embraces Catelyn like a long lost sister. As the children on both sides are brought forward and introduced, Robert steps back to Ned. ROBERT Take me down to your crypt. I want to pay my respects. CERSEI We’ve been riding since dawn. Surely, the dead will wait. 27. Robert gives her a hard look. Cersei stares back at him, uncowed. Finally Robert turns and walks away. After an awkward glance at the Queen, Ned leads Robert toward one of Winterfell’s old towers. INT. WINTERFELL - CRYPT STAIRS - DAY Ned holds a lantern as he leads Robert down the narrow, winding stone steps. ROBERT I thought we’d never get here. All the talk about my Seven Kingdoms... a man forgets your part is as big as the other six combined. (disbelief) It snowed on us! Snow! As they descend, their breath becomes more and more visible from the cold, and Robert’s becomes more and more labored. ROBERT How will you stand it, man, when winter finally comes? Your balls frozen right up into your guts for the next twenty, thirty years? NED The Starks will endure. We always have. ROBERT You need to come south, get a real taste of summer before it’s gone. Everyone is fat, drunk and rich. And the girls, Ned! Women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle... The king laughs happily, but his laughter trails off as the staircase ends. INT. WINTERFELL - CRYPT - CONTINUOUS Ned sweeps the lantern in a semicircle; shadows lurch along a procession of granite pillars that recede into the dark. NED She’s down at the end, your Grace. Side by side they proceed, their footsteps ringing off the stones as they walk among the dead of House Stark. 28. Between the pillars on either side, granite sculptures of the deceased sitting on thrones, their backs against their own sepulchres. Great stone direwolves curl around their feet. Ned stops at the last tomb and lifts the lantern. The crypt continues on into the darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs are empty, waiting for him and his children. In front of him, illuminated by the lantern, a beautiful young woman stares out at them with blind, granite eyes: Lyanna Stark, Ned’s sister. ROBERT She was more beautiful than that. Silently, Robert kneels and bows his head. Ned joins him. Robert’s voice is hoarse with remembered grief. ROBERT Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere, with the sun and the clouds above her. NED She was a Stark. This is her place. The king rises to touch her cheek, his fingers brushing the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. ROBERT In my dreams, I kill him every night. NED It’s done. The Targaryens are gone. The warrior Robert used to be surfaces in his face, pitiless. ROBERT Not all of them.
